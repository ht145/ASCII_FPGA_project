# ECE 540 final_project-video_ascii_art


The project will consist of adding camera functionality to the RvFPGA by interfacing a digital video camera (OV7670) with the RvFPGA softcore and displaying the output of the camera on a VGA capable display. Additionally, the project allows for the implementation of an “ASCII art” filter over the resulting image.
For an example of an “ASCII art” filter, please see the video below, which contains a video of the closing scene of Star Wars with an ASCII filter applied to the film.

Please note that our project will display the filter over data received in real time from the OV7670 and not archival Star Wars footage.
